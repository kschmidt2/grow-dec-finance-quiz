      <div class="intro">
          <p>If you find yourself searching terms like "investing" or "mortgage," you're not alone. "What is financial literacy?" is the second most Googled money question.</p>

          <p>So, what is financial literacy? The term refers to how well you understand personal finance topics and the basics of how money works. That includes, but is not limited to, saving for retirement, understanding how the stock market works, recession-proofing your career, and the credit scores you need to get the best rates every kind of loan.</p>
          
          <p>When it comes putting financial literacy knowledge to the test, [there's too much in this intro -- i'd start here:] Only 34% of respondents correctly answered four or more of the six personal finance questions on FINRA's 2018 National Financial Capability Study. FINRA, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, conducted an online survey of 27,091 American adults and an investor survey of 2,003 Americans who have investments outside of retirement accounts [what does this last part mean?]. [Respondents answered questions related to interest, inflation, mortgages, stocks, and bonds. <-- don't think we need this]</p>
          
          <p>In other words, 66% of respondents need help with basic money questions. So how do you become financially literate? Many people get their money education from their parents, who are the No. 1 influence on their kids when it comes to learning about personal finances. As of July 2019, 20 states require financial literacy classes for high schoolers. <-- this feels weird too. the answer to "how do you become financially literate" can't be "go back in time and have parents who teach you." maybe strike this and skip ahead, bc in the next graf we cover actions current grown ups can take]</p>
          
          <p>Experts say developing financial literacy should be an ongoing process, since it can help shape your relationship with money. There's a clear link between financial knowledge and financial well-being, and those who are financially literate are much more likely to plan for retirement and stay on course. [The fact of the matter is, many people acquire financial knowledge on their own — and sometimes, only after they've experienced a financial struggle. <-- strikes me as a bit weird too. could just remove. we want to get to the quiz itself more quickly, anyway.]</p>
          
          <p>We recreated FINRA's quiz so you can see how much you know about basic financial concepts, and where you may need to fill in some gaps. [If you don't know all the answers, don't fret. At Grow, we write about these topics a lot, and you can check out our resources on compound interest, inflation, and more. --> not crazy about this. in the quiz itself, if we offer resources, that's fine -- and that's enough.] And if you have a money question you'd like for us to address, email us at getgrowing@cnbc.com, and our expert money advice columnists, including Ramit Sethi and Farnoosh Torabi, may share their thoughts.</p>

                This is an example of how <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/what-is-compounding-and-how-does-it-work/">compound interest</a> works. In this scenario, your initial investment will grow by 2% each year. That means you’ll also earn 2% on the interest you’ve previously earned. After one year, you’ll have $102; after five years, your investment will be worth slightly more than $110. Because your <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/bobby-bonillas-contract-is-a-brilliant-example-of-the-power-of-compounding/">early investments</a> significantly add to the total amount invested, compound interest is the reason it’s important to start <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/millionaires-are-made-in-their-20s-and-30s-expert-says-heres-how/">saving for retirement</a> as soon as possible.

                  <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/inflations-on-the-rise-heres-what-that-means/">Inflation</a> means prices are going up on things we buy regularly, which means our purchasing power, or the value of our money, goes down. A 2% inflation rate means <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/inflation-rate-savings/">the purchasing power</a> of the money in your account decreases by 2%, so you would need an interest rate of more than that to be able to buy more than you can today.

                  When you buy <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/what-is-a-bond-/">bonds</a>, you’re loaning money to a government or corporation in exchange for a fixed interest rate and the expectation that you will be paid back by a specific date in the future. Bonds typically offer lower returns than stocks, but with less risk. When interest rates rise, <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/whats-driving-down-bond-prices-and-what-should-you-do/">bond prices fall</a> because investors can get better returns from other investments. Conversely, when people are <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/how-bonds-work-why-they-matter-and-how-to-include-them-in-a-portfolio/">eager to buy bonds</a>, it pushes the price higher and the rates lower.

                  Because you're eliminating the mortgage faster, you're paying less in interest overall. But it still <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/should-you-try-and-pay-off-your-mortgage-early/">might not be</a> the best financial decision. A shorter mortgage term comes with higher payments.

                  This is another example of compound interest in action, except this case shows how it can <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/credit-card-debt-in-college/">work against you</a>. In this scenario, you would owe $1,200 after the first year and $1,440 after the second because you are being charged interest on the interest you’ve already accumulated. This means after year three you’d owe $1,778, and would owe double your original debt, or $2,000, before reaching the four-year mark.
