                  This is an example of how compound interest works. In this scenario, your initial investment will grow by 2% each year, and so will the interest you’ve previously earned. This means that after five years, your investment will be worth slightly more than $110. Compound interest is the reason it’s important to start saving for retirement as soon as possible and why retired baseball player Bobby Bonilla is collecting deferred payments totalling almost $30 million on a $5.9 million contract.

              2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account is 1% a year and inflation is 2% a year. After one year, would the money in the account buy more than it does today, exactly the same or less than today?
            </div>

                <div class="response-explanation">
                    Inflation means prices are going up on things we buy regularly, which causes the value of our money to go down. A 2% inflation rate means the purchasing power of the money in your account decreases by 2%, so you would need an interest rate of more than that to be able to buy more than you can today.

                    When you buy bonds, you’re loaning money to a government or corporation in exchange for a fixed interest rate and the expectation that you will be paid back by a specific date in the future. Bonds typically offer lower returns than stocks, but with less risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall because investors can get better returns from other investments. Conversely, when people are eager to buy bonds, it pushes the price higher and the rates lower.

                    Paying off your mortgage sooner will decrease the overall amount of interest you pay, but it might not be the best financial decision. Let’s say you have a $200,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate. By the end of 30 years, you’ll have paid $144,000 in total interest. If you pay off the loan in 15 years by paying an extra $525 per month, you’ll pay just $66,000 in interest, saving you $78,000. However, if you invest that extra $525 every month instead and get a 6% annual return rate, you will have roughly $512,000 after 30 years.

                  It’s difficult to choose which individual stocks will outperform the market, even for the experts. Mutual funds, which are a type of index fund that is actively managed, allow you to invest in the overall market, which tends to go up over time. The diversification of stocks inherent in a mutual fund helps minimize your portfolio’s risk. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are another form of index fund that have become popular over the past few decades. They typically have lower fees, offer more tax efficiency, and are easier to trade when compared with mutual funds.

                    This is another example of compound interest in action, except this case shows how it can work against you. In this scenario, you would owe $1,200 after the first year and $1,440 after the second because you are being charged interest on the interest you’ve already accumulated. This means after year three you’d owe $1,778, and would cross the doubling mark of $2,000 in year four.
