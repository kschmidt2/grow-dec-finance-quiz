            1. Which of the following strategies is least likely to improve retirement security?

          <ul class="answers">
            <li data-correct="true">Saving an additional 3% of salary in the five years prior to retirement</li>
            <li data-correct="false">Working for two years past the planned retirement date</li>

              <div class="response-explanation">
                <p>Because five years doesn’t give your money much <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/compounding-penny-doubled/">time to compound</a>, the benefits of saving more right before you retire are minimal. Say you make $50,000 per year. Saving an extra 3% would mean an extra $1,500 per year or $125 per month. If we plug these numbers into <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/compound-interest-calculator/">Grow’s compound interest calculator</a> using a more conservative 5% annual return, you’d wind up with an additional $8,500 at the start of retirement, $7,500 of which you contributed yourself.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, delaying retirement two years has multiple benefits. It gives you extra time to save and your money extra time to compound. Retirement savings of $500,000 could grow to more than $550,000 in just two years, without any additional contributions. </p>
                <p>And for every year you wait to receive Social Security benefits from your full retirement age to age 70, <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/early_late.html#drcTable">your annual benefit increases by 8%</a>.</p>

              2. Which one of the following statements concerning the federal income tax treatment of distributions to a 65-year-old retiree is true?

                  Experts recommend investing in a Roth IRA if you’re in a lower tax bracket. While you’ll pay taxes on the money now, you’ll likely save in the long term, as your tax rate could be higher when you’re older and making more money.  “If you’re younger and in a lower tax bracket, you should shovel everything you can into a Roth account,” Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and founder of Ed Slott & Co., <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/saving-for-retirement-roth-ira/">told Grow earlier this year</a>.

A 4% inflation rate means the purchasing power of the money in your account decreases by 4%. </p>
                  <p>Since the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate, the value of your money is actually going down.
