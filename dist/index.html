                <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/compounding-penny-doubled/">Compound interest</a> is the interest you earn on your money, plus the interest it's already accrued. It is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by one plus the annual interest rate. After the first year, the principal amount becomes the total amount including interest previously earned. So, if you start with $100 and earn 5% interest, you would calculate 100 x 1.05 to get $105. The following year, you would calculate 105 x 1.05 to get $110.25, and so on. To see how this works, try our <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/compound-interest-calculator/">compound interest calculator.</a>
